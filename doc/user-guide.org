** Changes from v2.0

See [[./release3.org][Rawsugar 3.0 Release Notes]]

** Changes from v1.0

The main change in Rawsugar 2.0 is the introduction of *batches*, a new intermediate level of organization (see the next section for details). 

For CLI use, this means:
- there are some new batch specific commands like list-batches
- most commands that took a sheet argument now require a batch argument as well

The web interface has also been overhauled. The major changes;
- Projects and batches have their own pages
- File matching no longer is done on a separate page; instead it uses a flyout pane available from sheet view
- Ops machinery has an improved UI with interdependent selectors
- Bold new look with PICI branding
